# pass-the-message-project

This is js practice project #03 of 100. 

It was more challenging than the first two projects.

## Things Learned
- 'submit' event
- setTimeout

## Helpful Resources
[Form submit event listener](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-dom/javascript-form/) 

## Area for Further Development
I'm still trying to figure out how to get the alert message to disappear after a message is inputted.
